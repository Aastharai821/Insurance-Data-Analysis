### Distribution of Categorical Feature
 - The three charts display the distribution of policyholders by gender, smoking status, and region. The data shows a nearly equal number of male and female policyholders. However, a significantly higher number of non-smokers compared to smokers is observed. Among regions, the southeast has a slightly higher representation, while the other regions are fairly evenly distributed.
