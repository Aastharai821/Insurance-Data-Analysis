**Figure:** A pairplot showing relationships between age, BMI, number of children, and insurance charges. The analysis reveals that charges tend to increase with age. A few high-BMI individuals incur significantly higher charges, suggesting potential health risk factors. The number of children appears to have minimal impact on the cost of insurance. 

### Correlation Matrix of Numerical Features

**Figure:** A heatmap showing correlations between key numerical features. The strongest positive correlation is observed between age and charges, indicating that insurance costs tend to rise with age. BMI shows a weak correlation with charges, while the number of children has minimal correlation with any other variable.

### Impact of Smoking on Insurance Charges

**Figure:** A scatter plot displaying the relationship between age and insurance charges, differentiated by smoking status. The chart clearly shows that smokers are charged significantly higher premiums, especially as they age. This highlights smoking as a key risk factor influencing insurance costs.

### Average Charges Across Age Groups by Smoking Status

**Figure:** A line chart comparing average insurance charges for smokers and non-smokers across different age groups. The plot reveals that charges increase with age for both groups, but smokers consistently incur significantly higher costs, especially in older age bracketsâ€”highlighting the combined effect of age and smoking on premium rates.
