# Insurance-Data-Analysis using Python

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and linear regression modeling on a medical insurance dataset to uncover key insights and predict insurance charges based on individual characteristics.

## Dataset

- **Source:** `insurance.csv`
- **Features:**
  - `age`: Age of the policyholder
  - `sex`: Gender of the policyholder
  - `bmi`: Body Mass Index
  - `children`: Number of dependents
  - `smoker`: Smoker or non-smoker
  - `region`: Residential region
  - `charges`: Insurance cost

## Problem Statement

ABC Insurance aims to understand which factors influence medical insurance premiums. The goal is to analyze the dataset and build a model to predict charges using various customer attributes.

## Objectives

- Perform EDA to uncover patterns and relationships
- Visualize insights using Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Build and evaluate a simple linear regression model
- Provide business-level observations

## Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Findings

- Smokers pay significantly higher premiums than non-smokers.
- There is a positive correlation between age, BMI, and charges.
- Southeast region showed relatively higher charges.

## Model Summary

A linear regression model was used to predict `charges`. The model was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and visualized with predicted vs actual plots.
